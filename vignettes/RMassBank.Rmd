# Introduction

`RMassBank` is a two-part computational mass spectrometry workflow:

* In the first step, MSMS spectra of compounds are extracted from raw LC-MS data files, 
  the MSMS spectra are recalibrated using assigned fragment formulas, and effectively 
  denoised by using only annotated peaks (plus peaks which can be manually added.)
* In the second step, the processed, recalibrated, cleaned data is prepared for 
  submission to a MassBank database. Compounds are first automatically annotated using 
  information from the Chemical Translation Service (CTS). After manually checking and 
  fixing the annotations, the information is compiled together with the spectral data
  into MassBank records, which can then be uploaded to a MassBank database.

This vignette describes basic usage with the standard workflow. The package is
flexible and allows for different advanced use cases. Examples of specialized
applications of `RMassBank` are available at the `RMassBank` message board hosted
by the [Metabolomics-Forum](http://www.metabolomics-forum.com/viewforum.php?f=29).

# Installation and loading

The library is available from [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org).
In addition to the library itself, it is recommended to install the OpenBabel
chemical toolkit, available from [openbabel.org](http://www.openbabel.org) for various
platforms (or via Linux package distribution systems).

The library is loaded as follows

```{r}
library(RMassBank)
```

The data used in the following example is available as a package `RMassBankData`,
which must be installed separately and is loaded using 

```{r}
library(RMassBankData)
``` 

# Input files

## LC/MS data

`RMassBank` handles high-resolution LC/MS spectra in mzML format in
centroid (**The term "centroid" here refers to any kind of data which are
not in profile mode, i.e. don't have continuous m/z data. It does not refer to
the (mathematical) centroid peak, i.e. the area-weighted mass peak.**) or in
profile mode.
Data in the examples was acquired using an LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument in profile
mode, and converted from profile-mode RAW into centroid-mode mzML
using MSConvertGUI from ProteoWizard. The settings were as shown in the 
screenshot below (note the "Peak Picking" filter.)

In the standard workflow, the file names are used to identify a
compound: file names must be in the format `xxxxxxxx_1234_xxx.mzXML`,
where the xxx parts denote anything and the 1234 part denotes the compound ID in
the compound list (see below). Advanced and alternative uses can be implemented;
consult the implementation of `msms_workflow`  and `findMsMsHR` for
more information.

## Compound list

A compound list in CSV format is required to identify all compounds unambiguously. 
The CSV file is required to have at least the following columns, which are used for 
further processing and must be named correctly (but present in any order): `ID, Name, SMILES, RT,
CAS`. The columns `ID` and `SMILES` must be filled, the other columns
must be present in the file but do not need to be filled.
`ID` specifies an (arbitrary) numeric ID code which must be < 4 digits long; `SMILES` specifies
a SMILES code with the chemical structure of the compound (and is used to extract the
molecular formula, for calculation of molecular masses, for database searching in CTS etc.) 
Although the columns `Name, RT, CAS` have to be present, the
information in the columns is only used if the cells are filled.
RT, if present, specifies the retention time (in minutes; $\pm$ a window specified in the RMassBank options, see below)
where a LC/MS file is searched for the compound spectra. `CAS` and `Name`
are used as additional information while retrieving annotations from CTS. The
compound list doesn't have to be ordered in any particular way. It can contain large numbers of compounds,
even compounds which will not be actively used by the script (Note: Unused compounds
don't require a SMILES code, since they will not be accessed.)
